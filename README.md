What Is JSON? Syntax, Examples 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, human-readable, text-based format for storing and exchanging data, 
using key-value pairs and arrays, making it easy for humans to read and computers to parse, 
ideal for web apps and APIs to communicate data between servers and clients. Though rooted in JavaScript, 
it's language-independent, widely adopted, and simpler than alternatives like XML.

Working wuth JSON strings
1) It is possible to modify / replace substrings via any string-manipulating scripts

2) Much more easy and robust
- convert JSON to PS-CustomObject
- modify / read / ...  PS-CustomObject properties and elements
- reconvert PS-CustomObject back to JSON
