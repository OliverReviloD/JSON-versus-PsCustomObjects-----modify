What Is JSON? Syntax, Examples + Cheat Sheet
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, human-readable, text-based format for storing and exchanging data, 
using key-value pairs and arrays, making it easy for humans to read and computers to parse, 
ideal for web apps and APIs to communicate data between servers and clients. Though rooted in JavaScript, 
it's language-independent, widely adopted, and simpler than alternatives like XML. 

Example 1
      {
        "name":      "John Doe",
        "age":       30,
        "isStudent": false,
        "courses":   ["History","Math"],
        "address":   {
                      "city": "New York",
                     "zip": "10001"
                     }
      }
